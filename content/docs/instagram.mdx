**NOTE:** Please be advised that Instagram and Facebook can use the same app (no need to create two separate apps)


## Connection Options

There are two ways to connect to an Instagram account: by using a Facebook Business or through a standalone flow that connects directly to an Instagram account. Both methods will require a [Meta for Developers account](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).

## Setting up Meta Application

The following steps will guide you through the setup of a Meta application that can be used for connecting Instagram to Postiz.


### Create a new app
Select a business portfolio, then create a [new app in Meta for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/creation/).

Please be advised that for public applications, you will need to verify your business.
