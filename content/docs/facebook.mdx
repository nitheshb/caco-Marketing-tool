**Your Facebook OAuth2 Redirect URI:**
- Production: `https://your-postiz-domain.com/integrations/social/facebook`
- Local development: `http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/facebook`
- Docker: `http://localhost:5000/integrations/social/facebook`


### Request advanced permissions
![step 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81aa2a3-de66-4099-906b-b78c641d1a23)

Go to advanced permission and request access for the following scopes:
- `pages_show_list`
- `business_management`
- `pages_manage_posts`
- `pages_manage_engagement`
- `pages_read_engagement`
- `read_insights`

<Note>
If your Postiz install is for personal use only these advanced permissions are not required for Postiz to function.
</Note>


### Set app mode to Live
Change the App Mode from 'Development' to 'Live'. If you do not do this then posts made via the API will display for yourself but will not be visible for other users.


### Copy your credentials
![Keys](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac11f87f-4951-47f8-8344-7fbc9de942e4)

Go to basic permissions copy your App ID and App Secret and paste them in your `.env` file

```env
FACEBOOK_APP_ID="app id"
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET="app secret"
```

Facebook should now be working!
